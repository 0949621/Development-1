    "- so far we have seen programs in `Turtle`, where the state is fixed;\n",
    "- programs can also manipulate the extension of the state, to store additional, auxiliary information;\n",
    "- this auxiliary information is often referred to as _variables_, as it can vary;\n",
    "- let us define a new language, `Var`, with the following statements:\n",
    "    - `V := N`, where `V` is a variable name and `N` is an arbitrary integer number (this is called **assignment**);\n",
    "    - `done`;\n",
    "    - `I;J`, where `I` and `J` are arbitrary statements.\n",
    "- define the semantics of `Var`, taking the time to illustrate each statement with an example, as:\n",
    "    - `eval(<V := N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[V := N]`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<done>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<I; J>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I';J>, S'` given that `eval(<I>,S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I'>, S'` and `I` $\\neq$ `done`;\n",

    "- of course this language is not very useful by itself; \n",
    "- what can we do with variables besides _writing_ them to the state? We can also read them!\n",
    "- let us augment `Var` by changing its assignment statement to:\n",
    "    - `V := E`, where `V` is a variable name and `E` becomes an _integer expression_;\n",
