    "    - moreover, by isolating the crucial information that determines the picture, we have found ways to create a new picture from an existing one:\n",
    "        - negating\n",
    "        - flipping\n",
    "        - transposing\n",
    "    - furthermore, given two pictures, we can combine them together\n",
    "    - this looks a lot like a datatype like we discussed when talking about expressions\n",
    "    - we could say that `Pic` is a datatype, and its values are all the boolean expressions between two integers $(x,y)$\n",
    "    - we also have three unary operators (negating, flipping, transposing) and two binary operators (summing and multiplying)\n",
    "        - draw them: $Pic \\times Pic \\overset{\\texttt{or}}{\\longrightarrow} Pic$, for example $(x \\leq y), (x = 0) \\overset{\\texttt{or}}{\\longrightarrow} (x \\leq) \\wedge (x = 0)$\n",
    "    - so `Pic` is not really structurally different from `Int`, `String`, or the other datatypes!\n"
