    "**Note:** for this exercise assume that we use a Cartesian reference system, where the horizontal axis points to the right and the vertical axis points upwards. The intersection point of the axes has coordinates (0,0). Moreover, assume that all the given directions are relative to the axes and not to the direction you are facing, thus left and right are to be intended along the horizontal axis and up and down are to be intended along the vertical axis. Also assume that the first coordinate is the position along the horizontal axis and the second the position along the vertical axis.\n",

While one of the coordinates of your position is > 0 move one step left and one step down. If your position along the horizontal axis is < 0 then move one step right, else move one step left._\n",
