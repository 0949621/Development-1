SEMI-FORMAL SEMANTICS of FOR-LOOPS


  Nesting for-loops
  1. Each step of a for-loop can contain arbitrary code that will be repeated.
  2. This arbitrary code can also contain loops
  3. Loops within loops have a ``multiplicative'' behaviour.
  4. Each loop adds its own iteration variable.
  5. The iteration variables, together, are an N-dimensional point.
  6. A single loop performs a ``linear'' computation, two loops perform a ``square''     computation, three perform a ``cubic'' computation, etc.
  7. Still, multiple loops inside each other can be translated into a single for-loop
